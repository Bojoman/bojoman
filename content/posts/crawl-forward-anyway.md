This photo was taken during my rite of passage leadership training, deep in the forest. We had to crawl through narrow, muddy tunnels with no light…

We started at dawn, the forest floor damp from last night’s rain. My heart pounded as I pressed my body flat…

- Resilience: persistence is your greatest tool.
- Trust: guiding each other through every turn.
- Focus: distractions vanish when you live each moment.

That same determination fuels Tech4Village. When resources are scarce, we crawl forward anyway—finding solutions one step at a time.

**Because progress often looks messy—but it starts with a single crawl.**
