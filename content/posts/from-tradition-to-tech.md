When I stood up to speak at my Kikuyu rite of passage, I wasn't just wearing traditionâ€”I was stepping into it.

At 14, I was chosen to lead my rÃ­ka (age group)â€¦

- ðŸ’» No laptops.
- ðŸ“¶ No Wiâ€‘Fi.
- ðŸ“± No smartphones.

Now, at 17, I'm leading Tech4Village to collect and distribute refurbished devicesâ€¦

**And I'm just getting started.**
