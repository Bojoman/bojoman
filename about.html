              <p>At 17, I'm a social entrepreneur from rural Kenya, turning a rite of passage into a mission. I've launched a youth-led project called Tech4Village, where we collect and distribute recycled laptops and smartphones to underprivileged schools and rural centers. Our goal is to bridge the digital divide by giving young people access to tools to advance in this technologically advanced world.</p>
              <p>As School Captain in 2023, I led my peers with vision, and as VP of Student Government in 2022 and Chess Club Leader in 2021, I honed my leadership skills. Now, preparing for Harvard, Virginia Tech, or similar institutions, I'm driven to expand Tech4Village's impact.</p>
              <p>I'm reaching out to kindly ask if you would consider donating a used, working device, supporting our mission financially, or helping us spread the word. Every single donation‚Äîbig or small‚Äîwill help youth who are eager to learn but locked out by a lack of access. If you'd like to help or learn more, I'd be grateful to tell you more. Thank you for considering.</p>
